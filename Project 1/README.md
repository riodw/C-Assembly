Answers.txt

1. 
	pl =   8548
	pl.c = 164
	pl.o = 1488

2.
	pla =   8549 
	pla.c = 536
	pla.o = 1512

3.
	plb =   8604
	plb.c = 236
	plb.o = 1648

4.
	plc =   8549
	plc.c = 229
	plc.o = 1632

5.
	pld =   8602
	pld.c = 489
	pld.o = 2000

6. How do the sizes of the five object files compare?
	pl.o = 1488 | pla.o = 1512 | plb.o = 1648 | plc.o = 1632 | pld.o = 2000
	The sizes of the five objects seem to have a general increase from the first to the last.

7. A. How do the sizes of the five executable files compare?
	pl = 8548 | pla = 8549 | plb = 8604 | plc = 8549 | pld = 8602
	The sizes of the five executable files seem to average at the same size.

7. B. Do these versions do the same thing, or different things?
	I would say that the all do the same thing. In the end, the output looks identical across the board.
