### C Language
1. **[Project 1](https://github.com/riodw/C-Assembly/tree/master/Project%201) - Introduction to C**
  * *The goals of this assignment are to use some basic I/O, and get a sense of how C compares to other languages. You will write a series of programs, and turn in source listings and answers to some questions about the programs.*
  * pl.c
  * pla.c
  * plb.c
  * plc.c
  * pld.c
2. **[Project 2](https://github.com/riodw/C-Assembly/tree/master/Project%202) - Temperature Conversions**
  * P2File1.c - Formatted Output
  * P2File2.c - Basic Input
  * P2File3.c - Structure
  * P2File4.c - Loop, Tabular output
  * P2File5.c - Character Strings
3. **[Project 3](https://github.com/riodw/C-Assembly/tree/master/Project%203) - Parse Arithmetic Expression**
  * *Write a program that reads simple arithmetic expressions from stdin, and evaluates them.*
  * P3Case.c - Parse Arithmetic
4. **[Project 4](https://github.com/riodw/C-Assembly/tree/master/Project%204) - Counting Characters**
  * *Write a program that accepts a character string from the terminal, then counts the (ASCII) characters in its input, according to the kind of character. Once the input is finished, print a formatted table showing the results.*
  * Project4.c - Counting Characters
5. **[Project 5](https://github.com/riodw/C-Assembly/tree/master/Project%205) - Using Strings and Pointers**
  * *Write a program that accepts (a) a code indicating a string processing operation to be performed, and (b) one or more text strings to be processed.*
  * Project5.c - String Pointers
6. **[Project 6](https://github.com/riodw/C-Assembly/tree/master/Project%206) - Conversions of Unsigned Numbers**
  * *This assignment calls for two separate (but related) programs. The programs perform number conversions.*
  * Project6-pt1.c - Decimal-to-base Conversion
  * Project6-pt2.c - Base-to-decimal Conversion
7. **[Project 7](https://github.com/riodw/C-Assembly/tree/master/Project%207) - Signed, Fixed-point Conversions**
  * signed_magnitude2base.c - Signed, Fixed-point Conversions
  
### Assembly Language
8. **[Project 8](https://github.com/riodw/C-Assembly/tree/master/Project%208) - Assembly-Language puts()**
  * *Implement the C "puts()"function as an assembly-language routine, and modify the "hello-world" assembly program to use it.*
  * puts.asm - C `puts()` in Assembly
  * test.c - Test puts() assembly function
9. **[Project 9](https://github.com/riodw/C-Assembly/tree/master/Project%209) - Harmonic Mean**
  * *Write a program that reads a series of floating-point numbers from stdin into an array, then calculates the harmonic mean of the numbers.*
  * harmean.asm - assembly harmonic average calculator
  * Project9.c
